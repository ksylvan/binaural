# Sequence of audio generation steps
steps:
  # 1. Beta phase (stable 18 Hz beat)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 18 # Hz (binaural beat frequency)
    duration: 3   # minutes

  # 2. Transition from Beta (18 Hz) to Alpha (10 Hz)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 18 # Hz
    end_frequency: 10   # Hz
    duration: 5         # minutes

  # 3. Transition from Alpha (10 Hz) to Theta (6 Hz)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 10 # Hz
    end_frequency: 6    # Hz
    duration: 5         # minutes

  # 4. Transition from Theta (6 Hz) to Delta (2 Hz)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 6  # Hz
    end_frequency: 2    # Hz
    duration: 7         # minutes
