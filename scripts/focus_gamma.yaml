    frequency: 10 # Hz (Alpha)
    duration: 2 # minutes

  # 2. Transition up through Beta (5 minutes)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 10 (implied)
    end_frequency: 20 # Hz (Mid-Beta)
    duration: 5 # minutes

  # 3. Transition further to Gamma (3 minutes)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 20 (implied)
    end_frequency: 40 # Hz (Gamma)
    duration: 3 # minutes

  # 4. Hold Gamma for peak concentration (15 minutes)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 40 # Hz (Gamma)
    duration: 15 # minutes

  # 5. Gentle ramp down back to Beta (3 minutes)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 40 (implied)
    end_frequency: 15 # Hz (Low Beta)
    duration: 3 # minutes

  # 6. Hold low Beta to ease out (2 minutes)
