# Lucid Dreaming Binaural Beat Script
# Total Duration: 45 minutes
# Purpose: To induce REM sleep and enhance lucid dreaming potential

# Global settings
base_frequency: 200 # Hz (higher carrier frequency for better perception during sleep)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (standard audio sample rate)
output_filename: "audio/lucid_dreaming.flac" # Output file name (FLAC format)

# Research basis:
# - Sleep onset is facilitated by Alpha (8-12 Hz) transitioning to Theta (4-7 Hz)
# - REM sleep contains mixed frequencies with Theta components
# - Lucid dreaming correlates with higher Gamma activity (40 Hz) during REM
# - Studies show 40 Hz binaural beats may increase lucidity awareness (Stumbrys et al., 2014)

# Total Duration: 60 minutes
# This script is designed to guide the listener through a series of brainwave states
# that promote relaxation, sleep onset, and REM sleep, with a focus on enhancing the potential for lucid dreaming.
#
steps:
  # Phase 1: Relaxation (5 minutes)
  # Alpha waves to promote initial relaxation
  - type: stable
    frequency: 10 # Hz (mid-Alpha)
    duration: 5 # minutes

  # Phase 2: Sleep Onset Transition (10 minutes)
  # Gradually transition from Alpha to Theta to facilitate sleep entry
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 10 # Hz (Alpha)
    end_frequency: 6 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 10 # minutes

  # Phase 3: Deep Relaxation (10 minutes)
  # Stable Theta to deepen relaxation and prepare for REM entry
  - type: stable
    frequency: 6 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 10 # minutes

  # Phase 4: REM Sleep Induction (10 minutes)
  # Lower Theta frequencies associated with REM sleep onset
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 6 # Hz
    end_frequency: 4.5 # Hz (lower Theta, associated with REM)
    duration: 10 # minutes

  # Phase 5: Lucidity Enhancement (25 minutes)
  # Research indicates that 40 Hz (Gamma) binaural beats during REM may enhance lucid dream probability
  # This creates a Gamma overlay on Theta foundation to potentially stimulate lucid awareness during REM
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 4.5 # Hz (Theta/REM state)
    end_frequency: 40 # Hz (Gamma - lucidity enhancement)
    duration: 25 # minutes
