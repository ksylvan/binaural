# Binaural Beat Script for Sleep Induction (Delta Waves)
# Aims to guide the brain towards deep sleep states.

# Global settings
base_frequency: 90 # Hz (Lower carrier might feel 'softer')
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz
output_filename: "sleep_delta.wav"

# Sequence (Total Duration: 45 min)
steps:
  # 1. Start at low Alpha (calm baseline) (5 minutes)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 8 # Hz (Low Alpha)
    duration: 5  # minutes

  # 2. Transition down through Theta (10 minutes)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 8 (implied)
    end_frequency: 5 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 10     # minutes

  # 3. Hold Theta (light sleep/drowsiness) (10 minutes)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 5 # Hz (Theta)
    duration: 10 # minutes

  # 4. Transition slowly to Delta (10 minutes)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 5 (implied)
    end_frequency: 2 # Hz (Delta)
    duration: 10     # minutes

  # 5. Hold Delta for deep sleep induction (10 minutes)
  - type: stable
    frequency: 2 # Hz (Delta)
    duration: 10 # minutes
