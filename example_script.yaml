# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 25 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Beta phase (stable 18 Hz beat) with fade-in
  - type: stable
    frequency: 18 # Hz (binaural beat frequency)
    duration: 180 # 3 minutes
    fade_in_duration: 6

  # 2. Transition from Beta (18 Hz) to Alpha (10 Hz)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 18 # Hz
    end_frequency: 10
    duration: 300 # 5 minutes

  # 3. Transition from Alpha (10 Hz) to Theta (6 Hz)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 10
    end_frequency: 6
    duration: 300 # 5 minutes
    fade_in_duration: 3
    fade_out_duration: 3

  # 4. Transition from Theta (6 Hz) to Delta (2 Hz) with fade-out
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 6
    end_frequency: 2
    duration: 420 # 7 minutes
    fade_out_duration: 12

  # 5. Transition from Delta (2 Hz) to Gamma (40 Hz)
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 2
    end_frequency: 40
    duration: 300 # 5 minutes
    fade_in_duration: 6
    fade_out_duration: 15
