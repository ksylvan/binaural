# Example Binaural Beat Generation Script with Fades

# Global settings (optional)
base_frequency: 100 # Hz (carrier frequency)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (audio sample rate)
# Default output file name. Extension determines format (.wav or .flac).
output_filename: "audio/example_fade.flac"

# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 20 min)
steps:
  # 1. Beta phase (stable 18 Hz beat) with fade-in
  - type: stable
    frequency: 18 # Hz (binaural beat frequency)
    duration: 3 # minutes
    fade_in_duration: 0.1 # 6 seconds fade-in (linear ramp from 0 to full volume)

  # 2. Transition from Beta (18 Hz) to Alpha (10 Hz)
  # No fades specified, defaults to 0 (immediate full volume)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 18 # Hz
    end_frequency: 10 # Hz
    duration: 5 # minutes

  # 3. Transition from Alpha (10 Hz) to Theta (6 Hz)
  # Demonstrate both fade-in and fade-out within a single step
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 10 # Hz
    end_frequency: 6 # Hz
    duration: 5 # minutes
    fade_in_duration: 0.05 # 3 seconds fade-in
    fade_out_duration: 0.05 # 3 seconds fade-out

  # 4. Transition from Theta (6 Hz) to Delta (2 Hz) with fade-out
  # This fade-out applies only to the end of this step
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 6 # Hz
    end_frequency: 2 # Hz
    duration: 7 # minutes
    fade_out_duration: 0.2 # 12 seconds fade-out (linear ramp from full volume to 0)
