title: Example Binaural Beat Script
base_frequency: 100 # Hz (carrier frequency)
sample_rate: 44100 # Hz (audio sample rate)
output_filename: "audio/example_fade_noise.flac" # Default output file name

# Background noise settings (optional)
background_noise:
  type: "pink" # Type of noise: "white", "pink", "brown", or "none"
  amplitude: 0.15 # Relative amplitude (0.0 to 1.0)

# Sequence of audio generation steps (Total Duration: 1500 seconds = 25 minutes)
steps:
  # 1. Beta phase (stable 18 Hz beat) with fade-in
  - type: stable
    frequency: 18 # Hz (binaural beat frequency)
    duration: 180 # seconds (3 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 6 # seconds

  # 2. Transition from Beta (18 Hz) to Alpha (10 Hz)
  - type: transition
    start_frequency: 18 # Hz (explicit, could be implied)
    end_frequency: 10 # Hz
    duration: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)

  # 3. Transition from Alpha (10 Hz) to Theta (6 Hz) with fades
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 10 (implied from previous step)
    end_frequency: 6 # Hz
    duration: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 3 # seconds
    fade_out_duration: 3 # seconds

  # 4. Transition from Theta (6 Hz) to Delta (2 Hz) with fade-out
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 6 (implied)
    end_frequency: 2 # Hz
    duration: 420 # seconds (7 minutes)
    fade_out_duration: 12 # seconds

  # 5. Transition from Delta (2 Hz) to Gamma (40 Hz) with fades
  - type: transition
    # start_frequency: 2 (implied)
    end_frequency: 40 # Hz
    duration: 300 # seconds (5 minutes)
    fade_in_duration: 6 # seconds
    fade_out_duration: 15 # seconds
